# Fake-news-detection
project developed in Python 2.7

# Introduction 

In 2016, the prominence of disinformation within American political discourse was the subject of substantial attention, particularly following the surprise election of President Trump. The term ‘fake news’ became common parlance for the issue, particularly to describe factually incorrect and misleading articles published mostly for the purpose of making money through page views. In this project, we seek to produce a model that can accurately predict the likelihood that a given article is fake news.
Facebook has been at the epicentre of much critique following media attention. They have already implemented a feature for users to flag fake news on the site. However, it is clear from their public announcements that they are actively researching their ability to distinguish these articles in an automated way. Indeed, it is not an easy task. A given algorithm must be politically unbiased, since fake news exists on both ends of the spectrum and also give equal balance to legitimate news sources on either ends of the spectrum. In addition, the question of legitimacy is a difficult one: what makes a news site ‘legitimate’? Can this be determined in an objective way?

# Goal 

Aims to build a machine learning method that can distinguish the news from different sites as legitimate or not based on the popularity of the site and using sentiment analysis scores of the news tweets on Twitter.
